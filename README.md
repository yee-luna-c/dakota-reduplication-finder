# dakota-reduplication-finder
Python project created for Linguistics comprehensive exercise at Carleton College, designed to search a CSV corpus of Santee Dakota for possible cases of reduplication.

In the unlikely event that you're a fellow computational linguist wandering through Google results, I'll point you to `[spetools/](/spetools)`. You likely ended up here searching for scripts to process reduplication, or even SPE rules broadly, and `spetools` is the Python package I made for that purpose. It does have noteworthy limitations, so please do look through the header and other comments in each module before attempting to use or adapt it, but I do hope you find what you're looking for.
